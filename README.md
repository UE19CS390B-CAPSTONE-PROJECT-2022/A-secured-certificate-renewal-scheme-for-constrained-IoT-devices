# A-secured-certificate-renewal-scheme-for-constrained-IoT-devices
Secured certificate renewal scheme for Constrained IoT devices.
The constrained devices in the IoT network are classified into 3 categories based on processing 
power, size of state and buffers and code complexity such as RAM and Flash. 
They are named Class 0, Class 1 and Class 2 devices. These devices are not capable of performing complex encryption and
decryption quickly enough to be able to transmit data securely in real time.

Our project aims to secure Class 2 constrained devices by establishing a Key Distribution Centre that 
distributes secure keys to the network's IoT devices for safe and secure communication.

We also design a new certificate-based security scheme where we identify, authenticate, and provide 
security to the constrained IoT devices in the network by providing secure keys along with the 
certificate for encryption and decryption of data for communication. 
We also renew and revoke the certificates when required. We also identify the most efficient lightweight encryption algorithms 
suitable for constrained devices and implement them in our project.
